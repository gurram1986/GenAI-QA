# Purpose
Purpose: This is to test a GenAI model which is hosted in huggingface using APIs. This code would enable to create a strategic automated test suit for hitting range of texts and store the GPT response in a list. Later, this script can be enhanced to include conside similarity as well. 
Steps to use this, generate your API key from Hugging face (by just logging into HF account and generate it by going to settings tab of your account). 
If you want to hit a different model, then change the API URL accordingly(by generating a inference API of selected model in HF)
